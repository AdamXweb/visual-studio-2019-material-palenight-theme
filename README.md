# visual-studio-2017-palenight-theme
My attempt to port VSCode paleNight theme to Visual Studio 2017

Text colors are based on https://studiostyl.es/schemes/material-theme-pale-night

Far from pixel perfect... But that will do for me. Feel free to clone this repo and make this theme better !

## Installation

- Install the "Color Theme Editor for Visual Studio 2017" extension
- Import the .vstheme file
- Enable the theme (you might need to restart your IDE to get the result)
